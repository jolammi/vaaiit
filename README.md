# Vaaiit.fi
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/dadd80b0-9f61-4df1-82d3-f4affdf63174/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/brilliant-beignet-084e9a/deploys)

I bought [vaaiit.fi](vaaiit.fi) a while back to prevent someone else from spreading misinformaton with URL spoofing or trying to scam people. The address reminds of [vaalit.fi](vaalit.fi), which is a one-stop-shop for information about elections in Finland.

The site is built with Astro and TailwindCSS, and it is deployed via Netlify. It also acted as a way to test Netlify's deploy via a Github repo.
